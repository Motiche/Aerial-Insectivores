      <h1>Aerial Insectivores of Iran</h1>

        <div class="info col-md">
          <h3>What are they?</h3>
          <p>
            Aerial insectivore birds are a fascinating group of birds that have
            adapted to feed on insects while in flight. These birds are known
            for their remarkable agility and speed, which allows them to catch
            their prey in mid-air.
          </p>
          <h3>In Iran</h3>
          <p>
            Many of these birds are found in Iran, including Swifts, Swallows,
            Martins, Bee-eaters, Flycatchers and Warblers.
          </p>
          <h3>Population Trend</h3>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, the population of aerial insectivore birds worldwide
            is declining at an alarming rate. According to a study published in
            the journal Science, aerial insectivores have experienced a
            population decline of 53% since the 1970s. This trend is
            particularly concerning, as aerial insectivores are important
            indicators of ecosystem health.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info col-md">
          <h3>The Conservation and threats</h3>
          <p>
            There are several factors that are contributing to the decline of
            aerial insectivore birds. Habitat loss and fragmentation are major
            threats, as these birds rely on intact ecosystems to find the
            insects they need to survive. Climate change is also playing a role,
            as changing weather patterns can affect insect populations and the
            timing of migration. Another major threat to aerial insectivores is
            the widespread use of pesticides. Many of these chemicals are highly
            toxic to insects, which can have cascading effects on the food
            chain. When insect populations decline, the birds that rely on them
            for food also suffer. To help protect aerial insectivore birds, it
            is important to support habitat conservation and restoration
            efforts. This includes preserving intact ecosystems, restoring
            degraded habitats, and creating protected areas where these birds
            can thrive. Additionally, reducing pesticide use and promoting
            sustainable agricultural practices can help to minimize the impact
            of these chemicals on insect populations. In conclusion, aerial
            insectivore birds are an important and fascinating group of birds
            that play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem health. However,
            these birds are facing significant threats, including habitat loss,
            climate change, and pesticide use. To protect these birds and ensure
            their survival, it is crucial to support conservation efforts that
            promote habitat preservation and reduce the impact of human
            activities on their populations.

                Swifts are small to medium-sized birds with long, slender wings
                and streamlined bodies. They have a distinctive, cigar-shaped
                silhouette and can fly at high speeds, making them excellent
                aerial predators. Swifts are found in Iran from April to October
                and feed primarily on flying insects such as mosquitos, flies,
                and beetles. They are mostly migratory birds, spending their
                breeding season in Europe and Asia and migrating to Africa for
                the winter.
