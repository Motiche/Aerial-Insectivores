            <h3>What are they?</h3>
            <p>
              Aerial insectivore birds are a fascinating group of birds that
              have adapted to feed on insects while in flight. These birds are
              known for their remarkable agility and speed, which allows them to
              catch their prey in mid-air.
            </p>
            <h3>In Iran</h3>
            <p>
              Many of these birds are found in Iran, including Swifts, Swallows,
              Martins, Bee-eaters, Flycatchers and Warblers.
            </p>
            <h3>Population Trend</h3>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, the population of aerial insectivore birds
              worldwide is declining at an alarming rate. According to a study
              published in the journal Science, aerial insectivores have
              experienced a population decline of 53% since the 1970s. This
              trend is particularly concerning, as aerial insectivores are
              important indicators of ecosystem health.
            </p>

          <div class="info col-md m-3">
            <h3>The Conservation and threats</h3>
            <p>
              There are several factors that are contributing to the decline of
              aerial insectivore birds. Habitat loss and fragmentation are major
              threats, as these birds rely on intact ecosystems to find the
              insects they need to survive. Climate change is also playing a
              role, as changing weather patterns can affect insect populations
              and the timing of migration. Another major threat to aerial
              insectivores is the widespread use of pesticides. Many of these
              chemicals are highly toxic to insects, which can have cascading
              effects on the food chain. When insect populations decline, the
              birds that rely on them for food also suffer. To help protect
              aerial insectivore birds, it is important to support habitat
              conservation and restoration efforts. This includes preserving
              intact ecosystems, restoring degraded habitats, and creating
              protected areas where these birds can thrive. Additionally,
              reducing pesticide use and promoting sustainable agricultural
              practices can help to minimize the impact of these chemicals on
              insect populations. In conclusion, aerial insectivore birds are an
              important and fascinating group of birds that play a crucial role
              in maintaining ecosystem health. However, these birds are facing
              significant threats, including habitat loss, climate change, and
              pesticide use. To protect these birds and ensure their survival,
              it is crucial to support conservation efforts that promote habitat
              preservation and reduce the impact of human activities on their
              populations.

                  Swifts are small to medium-sized birds with long, slender
                  wings and streamlined bodies. They have a distinctive,
                  cigar-shaped silhouette and can fly at high speeds, making
                  them excellent aerial predators. Swifts are found in Iran from
                  April to October and feed primarily on flying insects such as
                  mosquitos, flies, and beetles. They are mostly migratory
                  birds, spending their breeding season in Europe and Asia and
                  migrating to Africa for the winter.
